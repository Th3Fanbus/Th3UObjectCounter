# Th3Fanbus' UObject Counter

This mod adds an in-game UObject counter. This mod is primarily intended to help diagnose issues regarding the UObject limit (if exceeded, the game crashes). If you're paranoid about hitting the UObject limit, then you should *not* use this mod â€” its own widget uses quite a few UObjects.

This mod's configuration lets you specify the "Warning" and "Danger" thresholds, which will make the widget's colors change to yellow and red, respectively. The default values were chosen without any scientific reasoning, but should be good enough for most people.

### Apologies
- to Ben, because I made a mod that lets people be even more paranoid about the UObject limit

### Thanks
- To Coffee Stain Studios, for making such an AWESOME game
- To the fine denizens of the Satisfactory Modding Discord, for all the help and being so welcoming
